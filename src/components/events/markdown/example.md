## 🎙️ Keynote Presentation – The Blockchain Trilemma

### 📌 Key Takeaways from Abhishek Singh’s Speech

Abhishek Singh elaborated on the **Blockchain Trilemma**, explaining the trade-offs between **security, scalability, and decentralization**:

- **Security:** Protecting the blockchain from attacks, fraud, and vulnerabilities.
- **Scalability:** Ensuring the blockchain can handle a high volume of transactions efficiently.
- **Decentralization:** Distributing control across multiple nodes to prevent central authority dominance.

### 🔍 Challenges & Trade-offs:

| Aspect                               | Challenge                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Security vs. Scalability**         | Higher scalability can weaken security.                                         |
| **Scalability vs. Decentralization** | Centralized solutions offer better scalability but compromise decentralization. |
| **Decentralization vs. Security**    | A highly decentralized network is harder to secure.                             |
