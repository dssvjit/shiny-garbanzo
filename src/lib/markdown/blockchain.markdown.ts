## Keynote Presentation - The Blockchain Trilemma
Abhishek Singh took over and discussed the **blockchain trilemma**, which describes the difficulty in simultaneously achieving three desirable characteristics in blockchain technology: security, scalability, and decentralization. Developers often prioritize two of these aspects, potentially sacrificing the third.


### Key Takeaways from Abhishek Singhâ€™s Speech

| **Aspect**        | **Description**  |
|------------------|----------------|
| **Security**     | Protecting the blockchain from malicious attacks, double-spending, and fraudulent transactions through robust cryptography, consensus mechanisms, and network security protocols. |
| **Scalability**  | The ability of a blockchain to handle a large volume of transactions quickly and efficiently without significant slowdowns or increased transaction fees. This involves optimizing block size, transaction processing, and network infrastructure. |
| **Decentralization** | Distributing power and control across many network participants, eliminating single points of failure and censorship through distributed consensus, open-source software, and a large, geographically diverse network of nodes. |

### Challenges and Trade-offs

| **Trade-off**                  | **Description**  |
|---------------------------------|----------------|
| **Security vs. Scalability**    | Increasing transaction throughput (scalability) can sometimes compromise security by making the network more vulnerable to attacks. |
| **Scalability vs. Decentralization** | Centralized solutions can often achieve higher scalability but at the cost of decentralization. |
| **Decentralization vs. Security**  | A highly decentralized network can be more difficult to secure, as coordinating security measures across a large number of independent participants can be complex. |

### Potential Solutions and Approaches

| **Solution**        | **Description**  |
|--------------------|----------------|
| **Layer-2 Scaling Solutions** | Building additional layers on top of the base blockchain to handle transactions off-chain, improving scalability without sacrificing security or decentralization (e.g., Lightning Network and Plasma). |
| **Sharding**       | Dividing the blockchain into smaller, more manageable pieces (shards) to process transactions in parallel, increasing throughput. |
| **Different Consensus Mechanisms** | Exploring alternative consensus mechanisms (e.g., Proof-of-Stake) that may offer better scalability or energy efficiency compared to Proof-of-Work. |

### Impact and Relevance
Understanding the blockchain trilemma is crucial for designing and developing effective blockchain applications. The choice of which aspects to prioritize depends on the specific use case and requirements of the application.

A few important topics discussed by the speaker were:

| **Topic**           | **Description**  |
|--------------------|----------------|
| **CBDC e-Rupee**  | FAQ on Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). |
| **Subprime Crisis** | The subprime mortgage crisis and its impact on financial systems. |
